# Elevator Synchronization Simulation

The task was to implement a multi-threaded simulation of an elevator system that manages people entering, moving, and leaving while adhering to a weight limit. The `Elevator` class ensures that people can only enter if the total weight does not exceed the limit, using a synchronization mechanism with a lock object. When a person attempts to enter, they must wait if the elevator's weight limit would be exceeded, and once space is available, they can proceed. The `Person` class represents an individual with a randomly assigned weight who enters the elevator, waits for it to move, and then exits. The `Main` class initializes an elevator with a predefined weight capacity and spawns multiple threads representing people using the elevator simultaneously. Proper thread synchronization is achieved through the use of `wait()` and `notifyAll()`, ensuring controlled access to the elevator and avoiding race conditions. The simulation demonstrates concurrent thread execution, mutual exclusion, and inter-thread communication.
